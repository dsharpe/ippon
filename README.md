# ippon

To run this demo locally, create the following entries in your /etc/hosts file:
* 127.0.0.1	ippon.books.com
* 127.0.0.1	ippon.magazines.com

This is modified from a spring example called "gs-routing-and-filtering-complete".

Import the projects into your IDE as a maven project. Gradle has not been tested. Each maven project runs on a different port.
